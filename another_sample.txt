There are a variety of different types of wine, from all over the world.
You can refer to old world wines or new world wines.
Old world wines are typically referring to those from Europe.
Old world wines are often labeled by their location, such as the appellation or chateau.
New world wines typically refer to wines from elsewhere in the world... such as Australia, the United States, South America, etc.
New world wines aren't named as strictly usually, and will often have the names of the grapes on the bottle as well.
Different appellations have different rules about winemaking, what grapes can be used, how much intervention the winemaker can do, and how to name them.
